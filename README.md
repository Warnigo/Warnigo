Hello, I'm Abubakir Shavkatov, a self-taught Frontend developer and BACK-END developer from Uzbekistan. My passion for the web is dreaming up ideas and realizing them with elegant interfaces. I pay a lot of attention to the experience, speed and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open source enthusiast and servant. I have learned a lot from the open source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happen through open source.
