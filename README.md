    <h1>Hello <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width='30' height='30' /></h1>
</div>

I'm a **Full stack developer**. I want my project to be the best in every way. I'm always learning new things in programming and always using new and effective skills

⛳️ My approach to the project consists of several sections. Firstly, I create a roadmap for my work because it helpes to rewriting the code or emitting errors. Secondly, I make sure my project is safe and secure. Finally, I start a project ✔️. 

🚀 The most important things for me are building trust with my clients, full understanding and high results. Additionally, I manage my time efficiently, which helps me to complete the tasks by the deadline. I write to my clients regularly to give them report of what I have done, so that they are aware of the matter.
